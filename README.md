## Setting up your IDE
Lombok is used to generate code. Download lombok plugin for your IDE and enable annotation processing in your IDE.

## Points
* Have tried to use industry standards for Rest based applications for URLs, response status code and response content based on the status code.
* Have used Integer as the identifier for Accounts to comply with the requirements. I would have preferred to use UUID instead of Integer as the identifier.
